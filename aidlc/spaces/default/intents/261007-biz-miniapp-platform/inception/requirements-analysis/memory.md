## Interpretations
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — chose REST over GraphQL; the consuming team only needs CRUD, revisit if subscriptions land -->
- 2026-10-08 — interpreted the approved MVP as a local portal and mock API flow; runtime loading and cache behavior remain deferred from this intent.

## Deviations
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — skipped the optional caching layer the stage prose suggested; the dataset is small enough that it adds risk -->

## Tradeoffs
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — picked TDD over BDD this run; the team is unit-first and the domain is well-understood -->
- 2026-10-08 — accepted a single mock admin role and deterministic resettable data to keep the demo small and repeatable.

## Open questions
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — confirm the retention window with compliance before the next stage hardens the schema -->
- 2026-10-08 — make validation bounds, error contracts, and the permission-failure scenario measurable before implementation.
